# Домашнее задание к занятию "7.3. Основы и принцип работы Терраформ"
1. Terraform backend создан в s3 хранилище в yandex cloud:
   ![terraform backend](./pictures/terraform%20backend.PNG)
2. Постарался адаптировать задание под yandex cloud.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
